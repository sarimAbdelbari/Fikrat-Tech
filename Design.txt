The design vision for Fikrat.tech is to create an experience that feels innovative, trustworthy, and visionary. We will use a dark, cosmic aesthetic combined with vibrant, glowing accents to evoke a sense of digital creation and the excitement of bringing an idea to life.

Color Palette
The primary color palette will be dark and sophisticated, with a deep charcoal or near-black background. This creates a canvas that allows the other colors to pop. The accent color will be a bright, saturated purple, similar to the one in your logo and hero section. This purple represents creativity, magic, and the digital realm. A secondary, lighter accent color, like a glowing white or light violet, will be used for text and subtle highlights to ensure readability.

Visual Elements
The Starvy website uses a combination of grid-like patterns, glowing lines, and abstract shapes that feel both futuristic and organized. We will adopt a similar approach.

Grids and Lines: Use a subtle, glowing grid overlay on the background of sections. This visual element will symbolize the structure and logic we bring to every project. Think of it as the "blueprint" for a digital product.

Glow and Light: The glowing light bulb in your logo is a key element. We will extend this concept with glowing button borders, highlights around key visuals, and a soft, "light leak" effect on some backgrounds. This visualizes the "spark" of an idea.

Organic vs. Structured: Juxtapose the rigid, technical lines of circuit boards and grids with more organic, hand-drawn-style elements, like the figure in your hero section. This blend shows that while we are technical experts, we are also creative partners.

Typography
We will use a clean, modern, and highly legible font. A sans-serif typeface, like the one used on the Starvy site, will reinforce the tech-focused, professional nature of the agency. Headers should be bold and prominent to guide the user's eye, while body text should be clear and comfortable to read against the dark background.

User Experience (UX)
The website's flow will be simple and intuitive, following the clear, linear structure you've already mapped out. Each section will be distinct but visually connected by the consistent color scheme and graphic elements. The design will be action-oriented, with clear and prominent Calls to Action (CTAs) that feel like an invitation to a journey, rather than a command.

By combining the dark, futuristic visuals of the Starvy site with your unique Fikrat logo and brand philosophy, the website will not only look stunning but will also tell a compelling story: that your agency is the perfect technical partner to turn a visionary idea into a tangible, beautiful reality.

This design vision ensures your site stands out while communicating professionalism, creativity, and a deep understanding of the digital product landscape.

Badge Implementation:
Service cards now feature contextual badges that enhance the visual hierarchy and provide quick value identification. Each badge uses a subtle background with glassmorphism effects (backdrop-blur) and color-coded themes:
- "Build Fast" (Purple) - for MVP/Prototype services
- "Scale Ready" (Blue) - for full-scale applications  
- "User First" (Pink) - for UX/UI design focus
- "Vision Driven" (Indigo) - for brand identity work

The badges are positioned at the top-left corner of each card with animated entrance effects, creating a modern tag system that helps users quickly understand the core value proposition of each service. This follows the cosmic design aesthetic with semi-transparent backgrounds and purple accent borders, maintaining consistency with the overall theme while adding functional visual elements.
